# System
This design document will describe the game system of Squaresy.

## Notes on this from Tim Cain

- Should be consistent with the setting (e.g. drugs/skills in Fallout)
- Every mechanic should have a goal or set of goals explained at the top of the page
    - _Need to answer_: why is this particular mechanic in the game? What does it add? Does it fit in with the setting, story, and design pillars.
