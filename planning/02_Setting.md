# Setting
This design document will describe the setting of Squaresy.

## Notes on this
1. Make setting evocative and interesting
2. Easy to explain, but "oh, there's a twist" - this twist allows for a lot of originality (e.g. Fallout - apocalyptic but 50s-themed)
3. Setting leads you into the story - story should allow you to explore the story
