# Design Pillars
This document describes the design pillars by which Squaresy will be made.

## 1. Game should feel like a warm hug
I want this game to be imbued with love. Tender yet funny, every character in the world should feel purposeful - each a celebration of life. If the game need be shorter or simpler to achieve this, then so be it!

The game loop and gameplay in general should always compliment this goal: 

1. Conflict, but no violence.
2. Game should reward _engaged_ play - especially in regards to helping other characters. Fun secrets abound.
